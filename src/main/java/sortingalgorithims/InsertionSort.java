    /*
     *This implementation:
     *
     * Takes an array of integers as input
     * Iterates through the array starting from the second element
     * For each element (current), compares it with previous elements
     * Shifts larger elements one position ahead
     * Inserts the key in its correct position
     * Time complexity: O(nÂ²) in worst and average cases, O(n) in best case
     * Space complexity: O(1) as it's an in-place sorting algorithm
