1. LinkedHashMap Overview:
      - LinkedHashMap extends HashMap and maintains a doubly linked list to preserve insertion order.
      - It offers predictable iteration order, which is the order in which keys were inserted.
      - Provides a constructor to maintain access order, useful for implementing LRU (Least Recently Used) caches.

2. Internal Working of LinkedHashMap:
     - Inherits the hashing mechanism from HashMap.
     - Maintains a doubly linked list running through all its entries to preserve the order.
     - Each entry maintains references to the next and previous entries.

3. Performance Considerations:
     - Both HashMap and LinkedHashMap have similar performance for basic operations like get and put.
     - LinkedHashMap may have a slight overhead due to the maintenance of the linked list.
