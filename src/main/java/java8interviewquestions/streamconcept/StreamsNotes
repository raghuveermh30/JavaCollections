Java Stream --Filter
-------------------

Collection: to represent the group of data/objects as Single Entity
Stream: to process the data from collection we use stream concept

Java Stream -- Map
----------
Map is an intermediate operations
Mapping the collection from one object to another.
Here, collections size will not be reduced, just we are mapping from one form to another
Map is transform the data from source and we can get into Target
Map will do transform the objects and result will be stored in the Target
Map will return a Single object from the stream
Map is performing One to One Operation

FlatMap Concept
--------------
FlatMap will be applied in the complex collection example
FlatMap will return another Stream and we can collect them in one Collection
It will return to stream of objects
Flatmap will return a Group of object from the stream
FlatMap is performing One to Many Operations

Java 8 methods
---------------
filter(), map(), flatMap(), distinct(), limit()
the above methods are also called Non-Terminal Operations

collect(), count(), min(), max(), forEach(), toArray()
the above methods are also called Terminal Operations

Collections --> Stream --> Non Terminal Operations --> Terminal Operations
